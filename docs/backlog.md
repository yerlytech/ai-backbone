# Backlog

What the backbone should do next: bugs, gaps and ideas, one line each, from
`just backbone-note` in any project and from the scheduled runs. Open lines
only: a line built is removed by the version that built it, and that version's
CHANGELOG entry is the record. A line carries a date and an id, never a
project's name: the backbone is public and knows no project (spec 024). A
`- [?]` line waits on the maintainer.
- [ ] 2026-10-16, n-ae82d7: stack-flutter.just writes the launchd agent (`just emulator-plist`: KeepAlive false, ProcessType Interactive, ANDROID_HOME, JAVA_HOME, PATH) and does not start the emulator as a child. bootstrap itself is not run from here. blocked: needs a Mac to run launchctl bootstrap gui/UID and to watch whether a busy machine still loses the device after install.
